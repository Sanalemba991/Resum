      description: "Dozens of students injured in violence following protests over alleged abduction and murder of two Meitei students, officials say. Authorities have imposed a curfew in the capital and some other places in India’s restive state of Manipur after dozens of students were injured in violence following protests against the alleged abduction and murder of two students. Ethnic violence has plunged the northeastern state bordering Myanmar into what many security experts describe as an intense civil war fought over land, jobs, and political clout between its two largest local groups. More than 80 students were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, another police official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the situation was “extremely tense” after armed mobs vandalized an office of the governing party and hurled petrol bombs at the police parties. Mobile internet services have been suspended in the state for five days",
